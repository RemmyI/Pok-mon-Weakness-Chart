		<h3>Searching</h3>
		<p>In this section I would like that have a input option that would serve as search bar to help filter out
			what specific Pokémon your looking for. These filtering options would be Name, Number, Type(s). Displayed
			besides these options will also be a image (maybe a sprite?) of the Pokémon. Once the user has pinpointed
			the Pokemon they're looking for, they can click on it and have the information displayed. The
			information planned so far will be what the Pokémon is weak/strong against.</p>
		<h4>Name</h4>
		<p>Almost everyone knows who Pikachu is right? Well this filter option would allow the user to be able to
			search for the Pokémon in mind if they the name in hand.</p>
		<h4>Number</h4>
		<p> There are 1010 Pokémon as of right now and every one of them has a number they're attached to. If a name
			is not the route the user wants to take and they have a number they wish to look for then that would
			also be an option.</p>
		<h4>Type</h4>
		<p>I would like this option to be included as well because maybe the user is looking for a specific type of
			Pokémon but not as specific as a name or number. This could be used to cast a bigger net so to speak.
			Rather than a smaller net like name or number.</p>


		<h3>Attack</h3>
		<p>This page will be built in a way so that the user can get a information on whether a specific more will
			be
			weak against another type or strong against it. By that I am referring to whether the damage taken by
			your opponent will be half or double or even quadruple. The API I plan to use covers the math needed for
			this and is pretty simple. The user will see a page of all available types to choose from. They have the
			option to choose the type that their move is and the opponent Pokemon type. Once chosen the page will
			display what kind of damage will be done. </p>

		<article>
			<h3>Defense</h3>
			<p>This page will be build similar to the Attack page. The difference with this page will be that the user
				can choose what 1 or 2 types their own Pokémon are and what weakness they may or may not have. </p>

			<p>My website will take inspiration from the <a href="https://www.pkmn.help/offense/?types=dark+flying"

				information to go through, Pokemon has been around for 27 years.</p>
