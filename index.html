		<h2>Beginner's Guide</h2>
		<p>This website is meant to be a tool for anyone who plays Pokémon games. Wether you are a veteran or a
			beginner, I think we can all agree there are A LOT of pokémon types and it gets a bit confusing trying
			to
			figure out who's weak to what or what does more damage. Thats where this website steps in.

			<p>The battle proceeds in a turn-based fashion, with each player taking turns to make
				decisions for their Pokémon.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Each Pokémon can perform different moves, which can include offensive attacks, defensive
				maneuvers, status-altering effects, or healing abilities. Moves have varying types (e.g., Fire, Water,
				Electric) and power levels.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Pokémon types play a crucial role in battles. Each Pokémon has one or two types, and
				certain types are strong or weak against others. For example, a Water-type move is effective against
				Fire-types but weak against Grass-types. Understanding type matchups can give you an advantage in
				battles.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Players strategize by considering the type matchups, Pokémon levels, move sets, and
				other factors. They decide which move to use, whether to switch Pokémon, or use items like healing
				potions.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Pokémon have Hit Points (HP), which represent their health. When a Pokémon's HP reaches
				zero, it faints and can no longer battle. Moves can also inflict status conditions like poisoning,
				paralysis, or sleep, affecting a Pokémon's performance.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Pokémon gain experience points (XP) when they participate in battles.
				Accumulating enough XP allows them to level up, increasing their stats and sometimes allowing them to
				learn new moves or evolve into more powerful forms.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>The battle continues until one player defeats all of the opposing player's Pokémon.
				The winning player receives rewards such as money, items, and sometimes the defeated Pokémon may also
				provide the option to be caught.
